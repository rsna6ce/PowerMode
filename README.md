## Updated Version (Maintained by rsna6ce)

This is an updated version of PowerMode, maintained to work with Notepad++ v8.8.1 as of May 2025. The plugin has been fixed to handle events properly and is compatible with modern versions of Notepad++.

### Changes
- Fixed event handling to support Scintilla 5.x (Notepad++ v8.6.5).
- Removed dependency on `SCN_MODIFIED` due to structure mismatch.
- Added support for copy/paste and Undo/Redo events.
- Removed debug logs and cleaned up the code.

1. Extract the downloaded `PowerMode.dll` (e.g., from `PowerMode-v1.0.0.zip`).
2. Copy it to `Notepad++/Plugins/PowerMode/`.

#### Option 2: Build from Source

2. Copy the generated `PowerMode.dll` (from the Debug/Release folder) to `Notepad++/Plugins/PowerMode/`.

# Power Mode
A completely useless Notepad++ plugin. Inspired by the [Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode).

## Installation
Download one of the [releases](https://github.com/dail8859/PowerMode/releases) and extract the DLL. Copy this into Notepad++'s plugin directory. This will either be located in the installation directory or under `%APPDATA%\Notepad++\plugins`.

## Development
The code has been developed using MSVC 2013. Building the Release configuration will generate the DLL which can be used by Notepad++. For convenience, MSVC copies the built DLL into the Notepad++ plugin directory.
